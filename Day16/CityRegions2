You are a database integrity engineer working for a global cloud company. 
Your team maintains a distributed database network, where each server either:
    - Stores equivalent data to another server (serverX == serverY).
    - Stores different data from another server (serverX != serverY).

The transitive consistency rule must be followed:
    - If A == B and B == C, then A == C must be true.
    - If A == B and B != C, then A != C must be true.

Your task is to analyze the given constraints and determine whether they 
follow transitive consistency. If all relations are consistent, return true; 
otherwise, return false

Input Format:
-------------
Space separated strnigs, list of relations

Output Format:
--------------
Print a boolean value, whether transitive law is obeyed or not.


Sample Input-1:
---------------
a==b c==d c!=e e==f

Sample Output-1:
----------------
true


Sample Input-2:
---------------
a==b b!=c c==a

Sample Output-2:
----------------
false

Explanation:
------------
{a, b} form one equivalence group.
{c} is declared equal to {a} (c == a), which means {a, b, c} should be equivalent.
However, b != c contradicts b == a and c == a.

Sample Input-3:
---------------
a==b b==c c!=d d!=e f==g g!=d

Sample Output-3:
----------------
true
